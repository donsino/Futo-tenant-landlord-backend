As part of my role in developing the Landlord and Tenant App, I worked on creating the User Registration Page, which is a crucial feature for ensuring a smooth onboarding experience for all users. 
The registration page serves as the gateway for both landlords and tenants to access the platform, and I focused on making this process as intuitive and secure as possible.


The dashboard serves as the central interface for users to access key features, monitor data, and manage activities within the app. It provides real-time insights, navigational controls, and actionable elements tailored to the user's preferences and permissions.
